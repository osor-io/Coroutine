        // deleted, if the coroutine has gotten a pointer to that memory, that could now be invalidated.
        //
        // This is just one of the most clearly obvious cases, but in general with any sort of data that's
        // referentiable outside the coroutine, issues could happen if you don't have it in mind.
        //
        // This obviously can happen without coroutines, for example with explicit state machines that do the
        // same functionality. But there you need to be more explicit about the things that are referenced, they
        // aren't comfortably available on local variables in the stack or registers, so the issue is easier to miss
        // when using coroutines.

        //
        //     if is_alive(monster)
        //     {
        //         heal(monster, 10);

        //         heal(monster, 10);
        //     }
        //
        // This above is potentially incorrect, because the monster could have died in the yields that happen
        // while we're waiting for 2 seconds. So what that code probably meant was to do the following:
        //
        //     if is_alive(monster)
        //     {
        //         heal(monster, 10);
        //         wait_for(2.0); // which yields

        //         heal(monster, 10);
        //     }
        //

        // Because we can jump back to our caller at any point maintaining out
        // local state, we can do stuff like this that would need to wait for a
        // certain time, but letting the caller resume with processing. In this case
